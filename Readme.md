# Mytoken Smart Contract
This repository contains a simple Ethereum smart contract named Mytoken. The contract is an implementation of the ERC20 token standard, which allows for the creation of fungible tokens on the blockchain while using openzeppelin.

# Features
- Minting Tokens: The contract has a mintToken function that allows the owner to mint new tokens and send them to a specified receiver.
- Burning Tokens: The contract has a burnToken function that allows the owner to burn their own tokens.
- Transferring Tokens: The contract inherits the transfer function from the ERC20 standard, which allows you to transfer tokens from one address to another.
